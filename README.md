## What is Capture the Flag (CTF)?

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve a series of challenges to find hidden flags. 

These flags are usually strings or codes that prove the successful completion of a challenge. CTFs are designed to test and improve participants' skills in various areas of cybersecurity, such as cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and more. Participants compete individually or in teams to solve the challenges and earn points.

 CTFs are a popular way for cybersecurity enthusiasts to learn and showcase their skills in a fun and competitive environment.
